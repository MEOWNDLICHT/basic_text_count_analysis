# TEXT COUNT ANALYSIS PROGRAM  
### CREATED BY meow


This program can be use to approximate the number of characters, words, sentences, and paragraphs in a .txt / .pdf / .docx file extension. This is especially accurate when used with .txt files as they are relatively easier to handle than .docx or .pdf files which has more complicated structures and thus requires more complex text extraction.  


## HOW DOES THIS WORK?  
Run the program via the text_count.py, and it'll prompt you to enter the directory of the file you wish to test. Enter the directory and wait for a couple of seconds. Afterwards it'll print out the results. Don't expect too much tho.
